He investigated the properties of very short radio waves, wireless telegraphy and radiation-induced fatigue in inorganic materials. His physiological work involved comparative measurements of the responses of plants exposed to stress. His invention of highly sensitive instruments for the detection of minute responses by living organisms to external stimuli enabled him to anticipate the parallelism between animal and plant tissues noted by later bio-physicists. In 1901, he proved that \"plants and animal have similar touch sense\". He founded Bose Research Institute in Calcutta and authored world famous books \"Response in Living and Non-Living\"(1902) and \"Nervous Merchanism of Plant\"(1926).",
